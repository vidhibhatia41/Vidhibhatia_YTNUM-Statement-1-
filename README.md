This wellness-focused application is designed to help users wind down, relax, and build healthy nighttime routines through a serene and immersive experience. Every feature is crafted to promote emotional balance, better sleep, and mental clarity.

✨ Guided Meditations & Ambient Soundscapes
Users can explore calming meditation sessions set in nature-inspired environments. Paired with ambient sounds like forest breezes, crackling fireplaces, or soft ocean waves, these sessions help reduce stress and ease the mind before sleep.

🏡 Virtual Relaxation Activities
The app encourages users to create cozy, comforting spaces through virtual activities—such as setting up a digital hygge corner, taking a virtual sauna break, or lighting a virtual candle. These micro-interactions simulate warmth and calm, helping users disconnect from daily tension.

🌙 Sleep-Inducing Tools
To support better sleep, users can access bedtime stories, sleep sounds, and a customizable sleep timer. Each component is designed to lull the mind into a peaceful state, improving sleep quality naturally and gently.

📔 Wellness Journey & Mood Logs
A personal wellness tracker helps users reflect on their mood, relaxation levels, and progress. Milestones like “First Calm Day” or “Consistent Sleep Week” motivate users and reinforce healthy habits without pressure.

🧠 Gentle Break Reminders & Digital Balance
Subtle nudges remind users to pause, breathe, or take a 5-minute wellness break—blending seamlessly into the interface. This prevents burnout and promotes mindful technology use without disrupting engagement.
